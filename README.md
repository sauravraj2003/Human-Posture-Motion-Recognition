## Human Activity Recognition Project

A machine learning project that classifies human activities using sensor data from smartphones. This project implements various classification algorithms to recognize daily activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and laying down.

Overview This project uses the UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models for activity classification. The dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from smartphones worn by 30 volunteers performing six different activities.
